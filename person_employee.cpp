// So here's the solution to the code challenge I was presented with, brimming with comments to show
// my thinking process and also show that I didn't just copy and paste things -- I actually took the time
// to learn this. There's still a lot to learn and I hope to get the chance to do that.

// Instructions:
// You may change anything in the code. Focus on:
// 1. Fix any compile errors.
// 2. Get the expected output.
// 3. Use proper OO techniques.
// 4. Identify and fix problems with the code that are not compiler errors.

// Expectation - code must print:
// name: Bob
// age: 50
// employee id: 175


#include <string>
#include <iostream>

// using namespace std;

I decided to comment this out because I've read that "using namespace std" may not be a best practice.
I read one article somewhere that said something about loading in a bunch of functionality that will
just bloat the program but the main concern seems to be the posibility of conflicting namespaces.

After doing a small amount of research "using namespace std" can cause conflicts.
From what I understand, say we have std::string and foo::string, if we went on to declare a string, it would
use foo::string and not std::string. Better to be explict I suppose - easier for bug fixing.

I'm curious what your team thinks about this.

  Also because it should be "m_name" etc that we're assigning.

  To the best of my knowledge, this would have worked if we hadn't
  used a pointer in our instantiation of employee.
